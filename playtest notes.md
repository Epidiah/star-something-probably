### 3 Locations
* [Encountered] A space-port carved into the sides of giant red cliffs that tower above an otherwise flat and barren plain. Ships parked here are tethered to the cliffs by rope bridges and float freely in the air. The locals travel between the port and the horizons carrying goods on the back of giant, featherless pteradons.
    * Home to Sister Kheee sh'Mwarr and her cat people.

* An ancient alien temple in the center of a crystal cave so massive that small space freighters can fly into it. Shimmering mist covers the ground, swirling in glistening eddies when disturbed.

* A palacial estate of ornately carved ivory geodesic domes surrounded by a vast, aromatic, well-kept garden of orange and yellow flowers, lavender and red hedge mazes, fruited orchards, burbbling fountains and ponds favored by silver swan-like birds. All of which is patroled by soldiers in grubby, ocher encounter suits riding atop flat steel platforms welded to digitigrade robot legs that are operated by levers.

### 3 Parties
* The Offiads, an group of siblings of indeterminant number, who travel the galaxy in their clunky frieghter, seeking ancient alien treasures they can sell in the void markets. They are UPHs with bulging compound eyes and poisons elbow spurs. The oldest, Ageth, rarely leaves the ship, except to shop for fresh produce. All the younger ones compete for her favor in their own, ambitious ways. Their interest is in plunder and resale. Most Offiads individually have MTs of 10 in fights, collectively 16. Ageth is a 19.

* [Encountered] Xillian, a wealthy collector of artifacts who employs a trio of bounty-hunting robots IX-34, IX-36, and IX-36G. He's an older budgie who remembers the empire from the early days of his youth. He believes that somewhere among the ancient alien artifacts exists the secrets to restoring the Budgie Empire. He's not above going into the field himself. Xillian's MT in a fray is only 13, but the IXs each have MTs of 19.

* [Encountered and in Custody] Borgie, a blorph duelist who has to go on the run because they killed a prince in a duel that was legal at the time, but the prince's family later made illegal. Keenly adept at the sonic saber. In a fight, Borgie has an MT of 19. In a sonic saber duel, that's a 22.

The Offiads and Xillian are often after the same objects and he has them under observation by the IXs in case the uncover something good. The Offiads won't sell to him because he has had two of their siblings killed for stealing from his personal collection. The IXs are on Xillian's retainer, but they recognize a lucrative bounty in Borgie.

### 3 Events
* A warp serpent, as wide as a battle cruiser and impossibly long, uncoils from the warp and temporarily halts intersteller travel while it swallows a large asteroid.
* A sudden shower of delicate blossoms in dark and light shades of blue and pink that obscure visual and olfactory senses.
* A regatta, complete with splendorous ships and cheering crowds from all social strata.
