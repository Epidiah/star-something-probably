# General Structure

## Session View
* The GM starts the session by setting the first Course and describing where everyone is and what is happening.
* The players champion their characters, describing their thoughts, actions, and words.
* Players and GM ask questions of each other through.
	* The questions available from spending Tokens are always available to be asked, but the GM is only compelled to answer them if an appropriate Token is spent.
* The GM describes the rest of the world and the characters in it.
* Rolls are made when a player's character attempts something chancy; something risky; something requiring time, effort, or resources; or if they seek the benefit of a high die.

## Roll View
*Note:* Rolling is often not about accomplishing something right away, but setting yourself up to accomplish it as soon as possible, or to get as close as you can, all while juggling other concerns.

1. Player describes their character's actions, taking care to be clear about the character's intent and how they are trying to achieve it.
2. The GM sets a threshold based on the character's intent.
	*  7: routine or trivial tasks
	* 10: something that can be accomplished right away with luck or skill
	* 13: tasks that usually take a few attempts or some preparation
	* 16: tasks only a highly skilled character can complete right away
3. The GM chooses the appropriate skill. If the character doesn't have the skill, they have a +0 in it. Only one skill should ever apply.
4. The GM declares which, if any, of the current Flows apply. Like skills, only one Flow should ever apply.
5. The player may negotiation over the GM's choices. Changing how you are doing it may affect the skill and the threshold. Changing the intent may affect the threshold and the Flow.
6. Once the skill, Flow, and threshold are settled upon, the player picks two dice from those available to their character and rolls them.
	* Both dice must be different from each other and different from the Course.
7. The player than elects one of those two dice to pair with the Course to resolve the roll, setting aside the other die and preserving its value so it may be set as the new Course when all of this is done.
	* See Results below.
8. Keeping the die results in mind, as well as the current nature of what is happening, the GM is allowed one last reaction to the roll before the new Course is set.
	* If the roll was dangerous and the high die was not Daring, this is when the harm is done. Likewise if the character was in peril of being noticed and the high die was not Sneaky.
9. Set the new Course. The die the player chose not to use is now the die type and face of the new Course. This player may not roll the dice again until someone else has set a new Course.

### Interpreting Results
There are three details to track for interpreting the results:
* Have the dice tied?
* Which is the highest die?
* What is the sum of the dice plus the Flow and the skill?

#### Ties = Dramatic Setback + Learning Experience
If the dice have tied, stop. Neither die can be the high die and there is no need to sum the dice.

The bad news is the characters are about to suffer a Dramatic Setback of the GM's choosing or invention. They are under no protections from a high die, so they may be noticed or harmed, and no Tokens can be spend to avoid the setback. If there is any Flow for this roll, zero it out.

The good news is, if the dice have tied on a value larger than the skill the character was using, they have had a Learning Experience and may increase that skill by 1.

Ties are generally bad worth avoiding if you can, though occasionally the silver lining of the Learning Experience makes them worthwhile. They are the only way to increase a skill, and if you don't already have much Flow, it might be worth taking.

#### High Die = Special Bonus or Protection
If there is no tie, then one of the dice is the high die and it will offer up a bonus or protection based on it's type.

Die Type | Bonus or Protection
---------|----------
Compelling Die | At least one being witness to these events is impressed by you.
Daring Die | Until the Course changes, you and your allies may not suffer harm.
Expertise Die | You do not lose Flow from this roll, even if you Take the Win or get your intent.
Sneaky Die | For this roll, only those you allow to notice your actions will.
Thriving Die | Choose 1 slot on any Destiny Track or Damage Matrix to recover.

If the bonus or protection does not apply to the current situation--for example, a high Daring die when there is no danger or a high Compelling Die when no one is there to see--then it is lost. You cannot save these for later. It is, however, worth noting that the recovery bonus from the Thriving die can be applied to anyone or any ship, whether or not they are currently present in the action.

These bonuses and protections are above and beyond the results determined by the sum of the dice, Flow, and skill. You can request similar results as an intent, but they must be the sole purpose of the intent. For example, you can make a roll with the intent of impressing the Star Court with your close-up magic. You can even include the Compelling die in your roll, increasing your odds of impressing at least one person in the court. But you cannot make your intent to steal the Activator Ring from the queen's finger while also impressing the Star Court. In that latter case, you need to make your intent to steal the Activator Ring and hope for the Compelling die to do the imressing for you.

#### Sum of Dice + Skill + Flow = Results
Add both the die you kept and the Course to the Flow and skill. If the sum is...

**...<= 6** Not quite yet. Add 1 to the Flow and describe how your character struggles with the challenges, or stumbles, or bides their time. Remember that you still get the bonus or protection from the high die _and_ this is not a Dramatic Setback. Only ties offer those. 

**...>= 7 and < the Threshold** You do not get your intent, but the GM must offer you a win. This win can be something close to your intent or orthagonal from it. For example, during a battle, your intent may be to drive off a MegaFederation Squad. The GM may offer you a chance to drive some of them off, but not the majority. Or the GM may present you with an opportunity to flee the battlefield unharmed. Of the GM may even offer a less desireable deal, like becoming the squad's prisoners. If you _Take the Win,_ you zero out the Flow you were using, but you get what the GM agreed to, plus the bonus or protection of the high die. *Note:* If the high die is Expertise, you do not have ot zero out the Flow when you agree to take the win.

**...>= the Threshold** You get your intent as stated along with the bonus or protection of the high die. Unfortunately, unless the high die is the Experise die, you must also zero out the Flow.

**Otherwise** you may always choose the <= 6 option instead of Taking a Win you don't care for or even getting your intent, should you change your mind.

### Gaining Tokens
Regardless of the results of the roll, if either the Course or the die you elect to run with is showing a 6, you gain a Token according to the die type. If they are both showing 6s, you still suffer a tie, but you get two Tokens, one for each die type.

Die Type | Token Type
---------|----------
Compelling Die | Rumor Token
Daring Die | Initiative Token
Expertise Die | Foresight Token
Sneaky Die | Clue Token
Thriving Die | Focus Token

### Helping
Players help out other players by setting helpful Courses. Characters help out other characters by default through the Flow mechanic.

## Dice

## Flow

## Tokens
All tokens do the same thing and vary only in how they are acquired and the vital questions they offer. Once you know the answer to a vital question, immediately add 1 to any related Flow, and if there is no related Flow, create a new one at +1.

* Clue Token
	1. What have others missed here that I have not?
	2. What detail that seemed insignificant in the past has new meaning now?
	3. What did I witness unnoticed before that gives me leverage now?
* Focus Token
	1. What should I be most concerned about here?
	2. What is only a distraction and can be safely ignored?
	3. Who needs the most help?
* Foresight Token
	1. What do they intend to do next?
	2. What have I done in preparation for this very moment?
	3. Which path before us has the best odds?
* Initiative Token
	1. Who is most vulnerable here?
	2. Where am I most needed?
	3. What is the swiftest route through all this?
* Rumor Token
	1. What warnings have I heard about this?
	2. What secret do I know that now presents an opportunity?
	3. How are they misinformed?
