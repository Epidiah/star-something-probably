# A Personal Tabletop Roleplaying Game Design Challenge
Hello and welcome to \*Something. I'm your faithful host and designer, [Epidiah Ravachol](http://www.dig1000holes.com). ~~This is a challenge I set for myself to design and publish an entire tabletop roleplaying game using only the tools I can access from the command line of my Raspberry Pi.~~

## ~~Why?~~ Why the change?
~~I'm not at all familiar with Linux or bash or Vim or Emacs and all their ilk, but I'd like to be. All the blog posts, helpful tutorials, books, and taped lectures have been tremendously informative and helpful, but ultimately, what I need is practice. I need to build the muscle memory. This is an excuse to get that practice in while also ostensibly working my day job.~~

That was the original purpose of the project, and a challenge I kept for a several weeks. I had a lot of fun learning how to use Vim and Emacs, as well as a number of other bash utilities, but two things happened:
1. I had a scare where I thought I lost an entire day's worth of work,
2. The vision for the game is coalescing around other technology that I need to learn.

That first bit was scary, but fortunately, only a misunderstanding. Whew. The second bit is important, though. I only have so much room for learning in my day, and almost all of it is accounted for at the moment.

Shifting gears now from let's play around with this idea to I have a vision of a finished product I need to reach.

## What's the game about?
Adventures in space with wizards and robots!

~~Don't know yet. Since git is a tool available from my command line, I'm using it to track my progress through my usual creative process. Not all of my game designs start off about something right from the get-go. Right now, as a placeholder, this one is sort of a space fantasy game. The kind with starships and robots and aliens, but also swords made of energy and strange sorceries. It suits the model I'm working on, for now. But in my experience, the majority of my games start off about one thing and end up about something else entirely before I'm through with it.~~

~~I'm cheating a bit putting this up on GitHub. I can push the repository just fine from my command line, but I don't know how to set it up on GitHub that way, just yet. So I had to fire up a web browser to get some of that done. But that's okay. It's not important to the process that the game is on GitHub. I just figured, as long as I was using git, I could use GitHub to share the process with you.~~

To that end, please feel free to use GitHub's features to interact with me. I don't know how any of them work and I'd like to learn. Submit an issue, make a pull request (whatever that is), etc. I'll try to respond however I can. Just be aware that ultimately this part is more of a byproduct of the core challenge, and not the end product.

## For Use With Your Imagination
