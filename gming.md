First off, we need a better term than GM and we need it fast. For now, I'm calling them the Starry Teller, and that's how it's going to stay *if you don't think of something better and quick!*

Second, the decider dice, based on that one mechanic I've put in every unpublished game of mine for the past five years...

# The Starry Teller's Roll
When the Starry Teller needs to roll to determine something random, they first look at the Course and decide what answer would fit if that die were the high die. Then they will choose a second die to roll and decide what answer would fit if that die were the high die. Roll that second die and compare it to the set Course, whichever is higher tells us which result was correct. If they tie, the Starry Teller must come up with a third answer that is one of the following:
* an exaggeration of one the two predetermined results,
* a synthesis of the predetermined results,
* or a third result, orthagonal to both predetermined results.

Two important notes:
1. The Course die does not change in value or type. Leave it as is, even if it is showing a 1 or a 6, thus precluding either its dominance or the other die's. That's fine! The previous player set the Course to that type and value for a reason, and if they wanted to a 1 for Expertise, they should get a 1 for Expertise. Besides, even though that 1 in Expertise can never be the high die, there can be a tie resulting in an exaggerated Expertise result, if the mood strikes.

2. The Starry Teller should *never* determine the tie result before rolling. It's good to know what results would come from a high Course or a high contrast die, but the result of a tie should be as much a surprise to the Starry Teller as it is to the other players. Do not waste creative energy on producing tie results that haven't and probably won't happen.

## Example
The PCs have landed on a planet and are greeted by a contingent of locals who have never met spacefarers before. The question is, how many locals are there? The Course die is a Sneaky [2]. The Starry Teller decides that a Sneaky result would be only a couple of cautious locals, but quite a few others hiding nearby, just in case they mean trouble. Then the Starry Teller chooses to pit the Compelling die against it and figures if that ended up high, it would mean a dozens of folks driven by curiousity have come to see who has arrived from the sky. The Starry Teller, of course, rolls a [2] so we can show you the third option in our example. In this cause, they choose a synthesis: dozens of curious folk have arrived, but the local authorities has set up an ambush that makes things tenser than they appear.

## The Starry Teller's Roll and Secrecy
Keep it secret, if you want. Especially if Sneaky is involved. After all, players might need to spend a token or two to thwart the results of these rolls. Also, it adds a bit of confusion if at every branching point in the story, players are presented with at least two possibilities, especially if they don't get to choose between the two of them.

Be open about it, if you want. From time to time, it can help add to the drama to know the results are random and to know what could have been. Just keep in mind the last point from the previous paragraph.

# 3 Locations/3 Parties/3 Events
Here's how a Starry Teller can generate an adventure from nothing:
* Write down three starkly different locations with strange and wonderful sceneries to chew;
* Write down three people or organizations with interests that compete with each other in a way that would be of interest to the player characters;
* Write down three events that can happen to change the course and tone of the adventure.

You do not have to use all of these, but they are lists you can come back to whenever you don't know where to turn next.

## Example

### 3 Locations
* A space-port carved into the sides of giant red cliffs that tower above an otherwise flat and barren plain. Ships parked here are tethered to the cliffs by rope bridges and float freely in the air. The locals travel between the port and the horizons carrying goods on the back of giant, featherless pteradons.
* An ancient alien temple in the center of a crystal cave so massive that small space freighters can fly into it. Shimmering mist covers the ground, swirling in glistening eddies when disturbed.
* A palacial estate of ornately carved ivory geodesic domes surrounded by a vast, aromatic, well-kept garden of orange and yellow flowers, lavender and red hedge mazes, fruited orchards, burbbling fountains and ponds favored by silver swan-like birds. All of which is patroled by soldiers in grubby, ocher encounter suits riding atop flat steel platforms welded to digitigrade robot legs that are operated by levers.

### 3 Parties
* The Offiads, an group of siblings of indeterminant number, who travel the galaxy in their clunky frieghter, seeking ancient alien treasures they can sell in the void markets. They are UPHs with bulging compound eyes and poisons elbow spurs. The oldest, Ageth, rarely leaves the ship, except to shop for fresh produce. All the younger ones compete for her favor in their own, ambitious ways. Their interest is in plunder and resale. Most Offiads individually have MTs of 10 in fights, collectively 16. Ageth is a 19.
* Xillian, a wealthy collector of artifacts who employs a trio of bounty-hunting robots IX-34, IX-36, and IX-36G. He's an older budgie who remembers the empire from the early days of his youth. He believes that somewhere among the ancient alien artifacts exists the secrets to restoring the Budgie Empire. He's not above going into the field himself. Xillian's MT in a fray is only 13, but the IXs each have MTs of 19.
* Borgie, a blorph duelist who has to go on the run because they killed a prince in a duel that was legal at the time, but the prince's family later made illegal. Keenly adept at the sonic saber. In a fight, Borgie has an MT of 19. In a sonic saber duel, that's a 22.

The Offiads and Xillian are often after the same objects and he has them under observation by the IXs in case the uncover something good. The Offiads won't sell to him because he has had two of their siblings killed for stealing from his personal collection. The IXs are on Xillian's retainer, but they recognize a lucrative bounty in Borgie.

### 3 Events
* A warp serpent, as wide as a battle cruiser and impossibly long, uncoils from the warp and temporarily halts intersteller travel while it swallows a large asteroid.
* A sudden shower of delicate blossoms in dark and light shades of blue and pink that obscure visual and olfactory senses.
* A regatta, complete with splendorous ships and cheering crowds from all social strata.


# Reward Tokens
Adventurers can get tokens from rolling 6s and from certain slots on Destiny tracks, but Starry Tellers can reward them with tokens for other situations.

I'll need a list of these tokens to offer: Cautious, Favor, etc. They should all have a set of 3 questions assigned to them.

You can set this as part of the adventure. Like, if it is investigative in nature, the Starry Teller might give the adventurers an Evidence tokens when evidence is unearthed.

# Setting Thresholds

|----------------------------------|-------------------|
|          If the task...          | Minimum Threshold |
|----------------------------------|-------------------|
| ...is routine                    |                 7 |
| ...can be done in one lucky shot |                10 |
| ...requires skill and/or time    |                13 |
| ...requires mastery              |                16 |
| ...requires mastery *and* time   |                19 |
| ...is opposed by a master        |                22 |
| ...is desperate but not hopeless |                34 |
|----------------------------------|-------------------|

Other modifiers include:
    * +3 if the PCs are outnumbered
    * +3 if the PCs are up against strange or unfamiliar tech/powers
        - This includes technology that might seem archaic
    * +1 per other disadvantage the PCs suffer under
        - Maximum of +3 from this. No need to count forever

## Monsters, NPCs, and Their Ilk

### Minimum Thresholds
NPCs and monsters can have Minimum Thresholds set for particular spheres. Such as a NPC duelist with Fighting 16/Fencing 20. Go with these when you encounter them.

### Dooms
Some very important or dangerous NPCs/Monsters also have Dooms. These aren't their Dooms, but rather a replacement for the PC's Dooms when they are dealing with them. Usually these are fates you don't want. Like the warp worm, whose Doom reads, "In space, no one can hear you scream as disappear from existence, but the ripple of your demise is felt everywhere. All allies, even those who aren't present, suffer 1 harm and are subject to this Doom unless they spend a token."

Some Dooms might be interesting to the players, though. Like a starcanthrope that dooms the PC to starcnathropy, which has an ability set and a specific Destiny track.

### Peril
The Peril of a monster or an NPC is the conditions under which they always cause harm (unless prevented by spending tokens or a high Daring die). Our duelist, for example, is always Perilous in a fight, unless it is Fencing *and* their opponent is on their last harm track. A vupple-beast is Perilous upon first encountering it when it sprays venom, and Perilous in a fight. The insectoid astro-scavengers are, by contrast, not Perilous in a fight until the flow used against them is 3 or higher.

Somethings can be Perilous just standing next to them, like a radioactive idol. Somethings can be Perilous long after they are gone, like a cute, furry creature that surprises you with a poisonous sting before crumbling to dust. Somethings hold off on how Perilous they are until odd situations, like a maintenance robot that shifts the atmosphere mixture toxic when it vacuums. Somthings depend on the rules to trigger their Peril, like a disease that is Perilous whenever you roll and Thriving isn't the Course.

Peril is just a way of talking about the fictional or mechanical positioning required for this thing to do harm.

### Let's Put It All Together
A collection of example characters and monsters using the above rules.

#### Borgie, the Blorph Duelist
An honorable duelist down on his luck. He has slain a prince (aged 40-something) in a legal duel that the monarchy now claims is illegal. He now has a bounty on his..., he now has a bounty on him.
* MTs:
    - Fighting: 16
    - Fencing: 20
* Peril:
    - In a fight, except when Fencing and their opponent is just before their Doom.
* Doom:
    - As normal.

#### Starwolves
Hunting in packs, these wolk-like creatures have fur that ranges in color from deep blues and purples to jet black, always speckled in motes of light.
* MTs:
    - While Hunting You:
        + Lone wolf: 16
        + As a pack: 19
    - Cornered:

        + As a pack: 16
    - While Being Hunted:
        + Lone wolf: 22
        + As a pack: 19
* Peril:
    - One when they specifically mean you harm, and then even their sonorous howls can be Perilous.
* Doom:
    - As normal.
