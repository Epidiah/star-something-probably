# Making Characters
I'm thinking characters will have:
* an Adventurer Type, which determines the dice they have access to and one other benefit,
* an Adventuring Career, which gives guidelines for skills to choose and hands over some neat piece of equipment or special power,
* a Species, because we're all alien in some way or form,
* And a Destiny, which covers what happens when they are not covered by a high Daring die and suffer harm as a result.

Let's start with my most thought out part, the Adventurer Type.

## Adventurer Type
Roll all five dice. The three highest determine your adventurer type. If there's a tie that put four or five dice in your top three slots, you can choose among those dice which three you want, or you can pick four dice and go for the Lone Adventurer.

Note: This method might make a combination of characters who don't have all the die types covered. That's something that *could* be fixed in character creation, but that won't guarantee having the a full set at game time what with everyone's schedules being what they are. Instead, at the start of each session, anyone who wants to, can swap one of their die types for one they don't have for the remainder of that session. This doesn't change any one's Adventurer Type, just the dice they have available for that session. Even with only two characters who have the exact same Adventurer Type, this should be enough to cover the full spread.

### The Types
C = Compelling, D = Daring, E = Expertise, S = Sneaky, T = Thriving
Not quite sold on this particular batch of adjectives just yet. All of the powers associated with the Adventurer Type should revolve around the dice you are rolling. They have a loose tie to the fiction through adjective associated with the type, but other than that, they're just one way in which you interact with the dice just a little different than everyone else. I have a sinking feeling that this will get too fiddly and I'll have to drop the powers, but let's see how they work in play.

* CDE: *Brash*--
* CDS: *Roguish*--If the Course offered to you is an Expertise die, you may choose to ignore it and use both of the dice you rolled instead, passing the old Course on to the next player. You may make this decision after you roll.
* CDT: *Bold*--
* CES: *Brilliant*--You may add 2 instead of 1 to your Flow for any roll you make in which the Course die is an Compelling die.
* CET: *Wise*--If the Course die is Daring, you may roll all 3 of your dice, discard one of your choosing before keeping another and swaping the third with the Course die, as usual.
* CST: *Charming*--
* DES: *Calculating*--You may add +2 to your roll if both the old Course die and the die you keep are greater than the die you pass on to the new Course.
* DET: *Mysterious*--
* DST: *Sly*--
* EST: *Clever*--You may add 2 instead of 1 to the Flow for any roll you make in which the Course die is a Sneaky die. * Any 4: *Lone*--Probably nothing beyond having 4 dice to choose from? Got to give this a think.

## Adventurer Careers
This is some classic stuff from the 80s and 90s. I'm too lazy to build them up right now, and that's a good thing. They should be built near the end, when the skill list and a bunch of other shit is finalized. That way I won't have to go through and rebuild them with every change. But they should basically look like a list of skills the career might have--say, five of them--and some starting equipment. So like this:

### Pilot
Primary Skill: Piloting: Space Ship
Secondary Skills: Astrogation, Gunnery, Pilot: Other, Repair: Space Ship
Equipment: Starfighter, vacuum suit, 30 creds, ray gun, chewing gum

You don't have to take these particular skills, but if you're in a hurry, you can just pick a career (or maybe even roll for it), slap your +3 in the primary skill, pick two secondary skills to slap your +2 in, give the rest +1s and leave your final +1 to define in play. Done.

## Destiny
All right, let's tackle this. Every player character, and probably some ships, have Destiny Tracks. When you take harm, it moves you one space on your Destiny track towards your Doom. When someone offers you a Recovery from a high Thriving die, you move one space on your Destiny track away from your Doom. So far, so very much like hit points. Let's come up with a sample Destiny Track. There's no generic Destiny Track, so we'll need something evocative to start from. How about my favorite broken old adventurer trope?

Harm moves down, recovery moves up.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Aches & Pains: Start here. Any recovery from here grants you a Hunch Token |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Beaten: Take a -3 to any roll in which you use the Daring die.             |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Broken: Take a -3 to any roll in which you use the Thriving die.           |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Push Through: Ignore previous penalties. Double the bonus given to you by  |
|	any Flow that works against whatever did this to you.                |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Doomed: Offer a soliquy to any younger character in earshot before you     |
|	pass on and add +6 to a Flow of your choice.			     |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Doomed characters are dead in whatever sense makes sense for them. Robots are destroyed, etc. They may be brought back, this is space fantasy after all, but for now, they are gone. Mourn them and make them proud.
