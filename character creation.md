# Making Characters

*Hey Eppy, these kiddos need a reason to adventure!*

I'm thinking characters will have:
* an Adventurer Type, which determines the dice they have access to and one other benefit,
* an Adventuring Career, which gives guidelines for skills to choose and hands over some neat piece of equipment or special power,
* a Species, because we're all alien in some way or form,
* And a Destiny, which covers what happens when they are not covered by a high Daring die and suffer harm as a result.

Let's start with my most thought out part, the Adventurer Type.

## Adventurer Type
Roll all five dice. The three highest determine your adventurer type. If there's a tie that put four or five dice in your top three slots, you can choose among those dice which three you want, or you can pick four dice and go for the Lone Adventurer.

Note: This method might make a combination of characters who don't have all the die types covered. That's something that *could* be fixed in character creation, but that won't guarantee having the a full set at game time what with everyone's schedules being what they are. Instead, at the start of each session, anyone who wants to, can swap one of their die types for one they don't have for the remainder of that session. This doesn't change any one's Adventurer Type, just the dice they have available for that session. Even with only two characters who have the exact same Adventurer Type, this should be enough to cover the full spread.

### The Types
C = Compelling, D = Daring, E = Expertise, S = Sneaky, T = Thriving
Not quite sold on this particular batch of adjectives just yet. All of the powers associated with the Adventurer Type should revolve around the dice you are rolling. They have a loose tie to the fiction through adjective associated with the type, but other than that, they're just one way in which you interact with the dice just a little different than everyone else. I have a sinking feeling that this will get too fiddly and I'll have to drop the powers, but let's see how they work in play.

* CDE: *Brash*--
* CDS: *Roguish*--If the Course offered to you is an Expertise die, you may choose to ignore it and use both of the dice you rolled instead, passing the old Course on to the next player. You may make this decision after you roll.
* CDT: *Bold*--
* CES: *Brilliant*--You may add 2 instead of 1 to your Flow for any roll you make in which the Course die is an Compelling die.
* CET: *Wise*--If the Course die is Daring, you may roll all 3 of your dice, discard one of your choosing before keeping another and swaping the third with the Course die, as usual.
* CST: *Charming*--
* DES: *Calculating*--You may add +2 to your roll if both the old Course die and the die you keep are greater than the die you pass on to the new Course.
* DET: *Mysterious*--
* DST: *Sly*--
* EST: *Clever*--You may add 2 instead of 1 to the Flow for any roll you make in which the Course die is a Sneaky die.
* Any 4: *Lone*--Probably nothing beyond having 4 dice to choose from? Got to give this a think.

## Adventurer Careers
This is some classic stuff from the 80s and 90s. I'm too lazy to build them up right now, and that's a good thing. They should be built near the end, when the skill list and a bunch of other shit is finalized. That way I won't have to go through and rebuild them with every change. But they should basically look like a list of skills the career might have--say, five of them--and some starting equipment. So like this:

### Pilot
Primary Skill: Piloting: Space Ship
Secondary Skills: Astrogation, Gunnery, Pilot: Other, Repair: Space Ship
Equipment: Starfighter, vacuum suit, 30 creds, ray gun, chewing gum

You don't have to take these particular skills, but if you're in a hurry, you can just pick a career (or maybe even roll for it), slap your +3 in the primary skill, pick two secondary skills to slap your +2 in, give the rest +1s and leave your final +1 to define in play. Done.

## Species
This is a whole blob of afforances and constraints. Species strictly just open up skills that would seem impossible to the ubiquitous pseudo-human (UPH). Things like Telepathy or Deep Sea Free Diving or Claws. Characters of these species may grab these skills like any other, or they may just leave them at +0 when they start play. The important bit is that the skill is available to them. It's a thing they can do, even if we normally don't expect folks to be able to do them because UPH don't.

This will cover manufactured life like robots and clones and sorcerous creations pretty nicely. The key will be to be evocative with the skill. Give a robot the skill High Grav Mass Lifter if you want it to be extra strong.

But wait, Eppy, how does a robot with High Grav Mass Lifer work in play? Especially if they took it at +0? How would that compare to Bertrude's Thews +2? Well, let's say A3P-13 and Bertrude are helping out heroes escape from a prison ship. The alarms are sounding and heavy portal doors are slamming shut. Everyone would be trapped in corridor but Bertrude and A3P-13 managed to get under the last two doors. They are holding them open let folks through. Here I have discovered that one should never state an intent that maintains the status quo. The game probably won't work if Bertrude or A3P-13 just want to hold the doors open long enough for the other players to slip through. But it will work if their intents are something like jamming the doors open. So let's go with that.

Bertrude's skill is just Thews. But it's a +2. She's strong, for a UPH. The GM sets her threshold at 19. That's fine. She's got the first door, so she only has to keep it open for a little bit. A3P-13's skill is High Grav Mass Lifter. But it's a +0. They're weak, for a robot that lifts cargo on high grav worlds. The GM set their threshold at 10. Everyone escaping is the same Flow. As the rolls play out, Bertrude is more likely to roll >= 7, which means she have some sweet Wins to the Take, but ultimately probably won't last long enough to actually jam the door open. Here's hoping those wins are enough to see everyone through. A3P-13, on the other hand, is going to depend on the Flow more and is less likely to see a Take the Win result, but might actually see a Full Success!

I'm going to have to ponder that for a bit. There's probably another little thing that has to go along with it. But if I can avoid that, I will.

## Destiny
All right, let's tackle this. Every player character, and probably some ships, have Destiny Tracks. When you take harm, it moves you one space on your Destiny track towards your Doom. When someone offers you a Recovery from a high Thriving die, you move one space on your Destiny track away from your Doom. So far, so very much like hit points. Let's come up with a sample Destiny Track. There's no generic Destiny Track, so we'll need something evocative to start from. How about my favorite [broken old adventurer](#old-and-broken) trope?

### Old and Broken
Harm moves down, recovery moves up.

- [x] Aches & Pains: Start here. Any recovery from here grants you a Focus Token.
- [ ] Beaten: Take a -3 to any roll in which you use the Daring die.             
- [ ] Broken: As Beaten, plus you take a -3 to any roll in which you use the Thriving die.           
- [ ] Push Through: Ignore previous penalties. Double the bonus given to you by any Flow that works against whatever did this to you.                
- [ ] Doomed: Offer a soliquy to any younger character in earshot before you pass on and add +6 to a Flow of your choice.			     

Doomed characters are dead in whatever sense makes sense for them. Robots are destroyed, etc. They may be brought back, this is space fantasy after all, but for now, they are gone. Mourn them and make them proud.

I rather like that part at the beginning where further recovery grants you a Token of one kind. I might go ahead and do that for all of them. That said, not all of them should follow the same path. Some raise you up early on, only to strike you down all the harder. We'll need a bunch of these. Maybe 8 to start with? I don't know quite yet.

~~Or, and hear me out here, Destinies might be a build your own sort of deal. Choose a Token that excess recovery gets you on one end and a Doom for the other, and the mix and match the middle? There could be two sorts of middle stuff: penalties that buy you another middle slot, and a bonus that fills the middle slot. So you get a start, a middle, and an end, and you can extend that middle with penalties. Maybe some safe guards to ensure no one backs themselves into a frustrating or fragile set. Got to think on this more.~~

Okay, I've heard you out, and I'm rejecting it. I've got to build all these. It'll be easier character creation, and more interesting, I think. If folks want to hack their own, that's their business, not mine. So, here's the base pattern:
* Start with everything normal, plus something you get if you recover from this position. That something should probably be a specific token. Since you can only have one of any specific token, this will limit the benefit you get by recovering from this already recovered state.
* The middle should be at least two spots, at most four. Oh, wait, I can think of one that deserves five, seel [Foolhardy](#foolhardy) below.
* The end is your Doom. It'll always have something you can do on your way out.

### Foolhardy
- [x] Idle Hands: Start here. A recovery from here grants you a Foresight Token.
- [ ] Boneheaded I: If you landed on this after a roll that uses the Expertise die, go to Boneheaded II instead.
- [ ] Fortune Favors: Gain a Fortune Token.
- [ ] Boneheaded II: If you landed on this after a roll that uses the Thriving die, go to Bonedheaded III instead, even if you just came here directly from Boneheaded I.
- [ ] Unbelieveable: Gain a Luck Token.
- [ ] Boneheaded III: After you choose which die to set in the Course, reroll it and set the course to that new value.
- [ ] Doomed: You get a single syllable utterance before your ultimate demise. For the next 3 sessions, each of your companions can recover once per session just by sweetly reminiscing about how you used to cheer them up.
