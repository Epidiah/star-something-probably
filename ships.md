# Starships

This is going to be a vital part of the game. None of that Star Frontiers BS where you tell your readers they're going to be exploring all of space and give them three big adventures stranded on a single planet.

## Space Battles
An important part of this complete breakfast are the dogfights and giant fleet battles in space (or in the upper atmosphere or across a frozen lake of nitrogen, whatever works).

These battles are going to play out much like everything else. No one will roll twice in a row. Folks will tell the Starry Teller what they intent to do and how they intend to do it. The Starry Teller will tell them what skill to use, which Flow is applied, and the threshold needed. Roll, as per usual, and the the usual results.

Tokens will work a bit differently, see [Sensors & Onboard Tokens](#sensors-&-onboard-tokens) below.

When you get hit in a space—or any sort of vehicular battle—your vessel takes it on the Damage Matrix.

### The Damage Matrix
In many ways, the Damage Matrix works like a Destiny for ships. When the ship takes harm, it will be recorded on the Damage Matrix and this will change the condition of the ship and affect how some of the rules work. But there are some key differences at work here:
    * The Damage Matrix is two-dimensional, a bundle of 3 to 6 Damage tracks.
        - By contrast, the Destiny track is one-dimensional.
    * Damage taken on a Damage Matrix is randomized, you roll one or two dice to determine where it hits.
        - By contrast, harm taken on a Destiny track always hits the next level.
    * Not all Damage Matrix tracks end. Some reach a point where the damage just repeats forever every time a new hit lands on it.
        - By contrast, Destiny tracks end in a Doom and go no further.
    * The tracks on a clean Damage Matrix start unharmed.
        - By contrast, you always have at least the starting spot on a Destiny track marked.
    * No Damage Matrix tracks offer any bonus for recovering from a start position.
        - By contrast, you can recover from a start position in a Destiny track and at least gain a token.
    * The Damage Matrix does not have to recover in order. When you get a chance to recover it, you can choose any damaged spot on any track, even if that leaves gaps in the track. When the track is hit again, the lowest, recovered track takes the damage.
        - By contrast, when you recover on a Destiny track, the highest harm is always recovered first.
    * The Shield track on the Damage Matrix affects the rules when they are *unharmed* rather than harmed.
        - By contrast, all other Damage and Matrix tracks only affect the rules when they take harm.

Here's an example and how it will work.

1. Shields
    1. Until this is hit, the next hit, no matter the roll, hits here.
    2. Until this is hit, ignore all second level hits that don't land here.
    3. Until this is hit, ignore all third level hits that don't land here.
    4. Until this is hit, ignore all fourth level hits that don't land here.
2. Engines
    1. Stalled Warp: Until this is repaired, you cannot make the jump to warp.
    2. Fire! Until this is recovered, roll an extra die every time you take damage.
    3. Random Power Outages: Until this is recovered, the Starry Teller may remove and reinstall power at will.
    4. Dead in the Void: Mark Stalled Warp if it is not already marked. Until this is repaired, you have no engines and cannot repair Stalled Warp.
3. Weapons
    1. Needs Calibrating: Add +2 to all gunnery thresholds.
    2. Misaligned: Add an additional +2 to all gunnery thresholds.
    3. Overheating: Until this is repaired, all characters operating the guns take harm when the Company takes a hit, even if the don't qualify for the harm done at that level.
    4. Systems Down: Now and until this is repaired, each time this is hit, a random weapon system goes offline.
4. Sensors
    1. Disarray: Add +3 to all sensor thresholds.
    2. Long Range Scans Down: Until this is repaired, scanner range is halved.
    3. False Positives: Until this is repaired, add a +3 to all piloting, gunnery and sensor based thresholds.
    4. Nothing But Static: Unless the Course is Expertise, the Starry Teller will halve an appropriate Flow each time this is hit.
5. Control
    1. Needs Calibrating: Add +1 to all piloting & gunnery thresholds.
    2. Misaligned: Add an additional +3 to all piloting & gunnery thresholds.
    3. Careening: As long as this damage exists, the pilot must use their roll to avoid colliding with something and taking an additional two dice of Damage. The threshold is based on how many things there are out here to collide with.
    4. Locking Up: Every hit here hereafter adds an addition +3 to piloting thresholds.
6. Company
    1. All crew at the start of their Destiny track mark one harm. Assorted non-player crew and passengers are bumped and bruised.
    2. All crew on the second place for their Destiny mark another harm. Assorted non-player crew and passengers are critically injured.
    3. Not this hit, but for every hit here hereafter the crewmember with the least Destiny marked marks another harm. Choose randomly if you have to. Assorted non-player crew and passengers could be fatally wounded.

When your ship suffers harm from a source equal to the task of harming it, roll 2 untyped dice. You're ship will be taking two hits, one for each system rolled on those dice. For each roll, look for the first undamaged location at that system, and damage it.

If the damage comes from a source unequal to the task, roll only one 1 untyped die. For example, a security squad firing ray pistols at your ship are only going to do a single die. Another ship will do 2 dice. And a massive battleship will still only do 2 dice.

When you take 2 dice of damage, resolve them in order from lowest to highest. If the dice are tied, instead of marking the two next levels of damage, you only mark the higher of the two. If this would skip off the end of the track, congrats, it was near miss! *Example:* You've already taken level 1 damage on Sensors and the next salvo rolls a double 4. Instead of taking a hit in level 2 and a hit in level 3, you skip 2 and only take the hit in level 3.

Damage Matrices can be applied to smaller vehicles and the like—perhaps even to mounts and battlesuits. If you are applying a Damage Matrix to something without a particular system—or equivalent to that system, simply leave that system off the matrix. Any roll that ends up in a missing system is merely a miss or cosmetic damage. For example, a riding lizard has no Shields or Engines, but it has the equivalent to Control (whether or not it is panicked), Weapons (teeth, claws and tail), Sensors (it's own keen senses and the rider's attention to them), and Company (the rider). Any roll of 1 or 2 simply miss, but it is also very likely that the riding lizard doesn't have a depth of 4 on each track.

### Sensors & Onboard Tokens
If you're character is part of a crew of a ship, even in an ad hoc or backseat pilot sort of way, you need only spend 1 token for the whole ship to avoid a surprise hoisted upon you by the Starry Teller. This is only possible if you are in direct control of whatever function of the ship you intend to use to avoid the surprise, or whoever is in control of it is paying attention to you. That should usually be the case, but sometimes you need a loud voice to make it the case.

This is the equivalent of spending 2 tokens so that the whole party avoids the situation, if the whole party is aboard your ship. If you are aboard multiple ships, 2 tokens can alert your little squadron, as usual. And it still takes 3 tokens to turn the tables.

Basically, when it comes to tokens, treat each ship as an individual character.

A ship with a working sensor array can also provide Sensor Tokens. Any character operating the sensors can get a Sensor Token by making a roll with their Sensor skill. Under normal circumstances, you just need to beat a 7 threshold. However, some foes might have minimum thresholds related to their ship's cloaking or stealth abilities. Additionally, some results on the ship's Damage Matrix can increase this threshold. If you beat the threshold, you get a Sensor Token. If one or more of your dice were 6s, you get those Tokens as well. Like all Tokens, you can only ever have 1 Sensor Token at a time, so spend it fast.

Sensor Token Questions:
* What danger or opportunity lurks in the louring dark?
* What signs of life or other activity can be found?
* How does that ship, planet, or other object floating in space differ from the usual technical specs?
